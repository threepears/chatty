# Chatty

A NSS classroom group project building a chat app

### Goal

Create an interactive message board, where users can enter text and submit to a display area.  Each entry should be dated, and it should be possible to delete entries.  You should also be able to clear the message board in its entirety, click a button that changes the CSS theme to darker presentation, and click a button which will enlarge all page text for readability.

### Required Tools

JQuery (CDN link), code editor
